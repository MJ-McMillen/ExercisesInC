 This piece of code is probably totally wrong at this point but it is late and I am too tired to debug.
 My first mistake when approaching this assignment was allowing it to overwhelm me. I looked at the docs
 for tee and was immediately confused and started googleing every single word i didnt understand which led
 me to pages with more words i didnt understand and it became a never ending vocabulary look up party. I
 should have not wasted so much time doing that and instead focused on what the code actually needed to do.

 My code differes from the actual real code because I bet their code works :) also, their code is a lot more
 complicated and I cant quite figure out what is going on. They include so many libraries its a bit daunting!
